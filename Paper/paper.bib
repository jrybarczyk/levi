  abstract     = {MicroRNAs play key roles in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. In this study, we described the regulation and function of miR-1469 in apoptosis of lung cancer cells (A549 and NCI-H1650). Expression analysis verified that miR-1469 expression significantly increased in apoptotic cells. Overexpression of miR-1469 in lung cancer cells increased cell apoptosis induced by etoposide. Additionally, we identified that Stat5a is a downstream target of miR-1469, which can bind directly to the 3'-untranslated region of the Stat5a, subsequently reducing both the mRNA and protein levels of Stat5a. Finally, co-expression of miR-1469 and Stat5a in A549 and NCI-H1650 cells partially abrogated the effect of miR-1469 on cell apoptosis. Our results show that miR-1469 functions as an apoptosis enhancer to regulate lung cancer apoptosis through targeting Stat5a and may become a critical therapeutic target in lung cancer. },
