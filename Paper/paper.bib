  abstract = {High-throughput studies of biological systems are rapidly accumulating a wealth of 'omics'-scale data. Visualization is a key aspect of both the analysis and understanding of these data, and users now have many visualization methods and tools to choose from. The challenge is to create clear, meaningful and integrated visualizations that give biological insight, without being overwhelmed by the intrinsic complexity of the data. In this review, we discuss how visualization tools are being used to help interpret protein interaction, gene expression and metabolic profile data, and we highlight emerging new directions.},

  abstract = {Network biology is a rapidly developing area of biomedical research and reflects the current view that complex phenotypes, such as disease susceptibility, are not the result of single gene mutations that act in isolation but are rather due to the perturbation of a gene’s network context. Understanding the topology of these molecular interaction networks and identifying the molecules that play central roles in their structure and regulation is a key to understanding complex systems. The falling cost of next-generation sequencing is now enabling researchers to routinely catalogue the molecular components of these networks at a genome-wide scale and over a large number of different conditions. In this review, we describe how to use publicly available bioinformatics tools to integrate genome-wide ‘omics’ data into a network of experimentally-supported molecular interactions. In addition, we describe how to visualize and analyze these networks to identify topological features of likely functional relevance, including network hubs, bottlenecks and modules. We show that network biology provides a powerful conceptual approach to integrate and find patterns in genome-wide genomic data but we also discuss the limitations and caveats of these methods, of which researchers adopting these methods must remain aware.},

  abstract           = {KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; https://www.kegg.jp/ or https://www.genome.jp/kegg/) is a reference knowledge base for biological interpretation of genome sequences and other high-throughput data. It is an integrated database consisting of three generic categories of systems information, genomic information and chemical information, and an additional human-specific category of health information. KEGG pathway maps, BRITE hierarchies and KEGG modules have been developed as generic molecular networks with KEGG Orthology nodes of functional orthologs so that KEGG pathway mapping and other procedures can be applied to any cellular organism. Unfortunately, however, this generic approach was inadequate for knowledge representation in the health information category, where variations of human genomes, especially disease-related variations, had to be considered. Thus, we have introduced a new approach where human gene variants are explicitly incorporated into what we call 'network variants' in the recently released KEGG NETWORK database. This allows accumulation of knowledge about disease-related perturbed molecular networks caused not only by gene variants, but also by viruses and other pathogens, environmental factors and drugs. We expect that KEGG NETWORK will become another reference knowledge base for the basic understanding of disease mechanisms and practical use in clinical sequencing and drug development.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is responsible for over 90% of lung cancer cases, and yet the precise molecular alterations induced by smoking in lung that develop into cancer and impact survival have remained obscure. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed gene expression analysis using HG-U133A Affymetrix chips on 135 fresh frozen tissue samples of adenocarcinoma and paired noninvolved lung tissue from current, former and never smokers, with biochemically validated smoking information. ANOVA analysis adjusted for potential confounders, multiple testing procedure, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, and GO-functional classification were conducted for gene selection. Results were confirmed in independent adenocarcinoma and non-tumor tissues from two studies. We identified a gene expression signature characteristic of smoking that includes cell cycle genes, particularly those involved in the mitotic spindle formation (e.g., NEK2, TTK, PRC1). Expression of these genes strongly differentiated both smokers from non-smokers in lung tumors and early stage tumor tissue from non-tumor tissue (p<0.001 and fold-change >1.5, for each comparison), consistent with an important role for this pathway in lung carcinogenesis induced by smoking. These changes persisted many years after smoking cessation. NEK2 (p<0.001) and TTK (p = 0.002) expression in the noninvolved lung tissue was also associated with a 3-fold increased risk of mortality from lung adenocarcinoma in smokers. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our work provides insight into the smoking-related mechanisms of lung neoplasia, and shows that the very mitotic genes known to be involved in cancer development are induced by smoking and affect survival. These genes are candidate targets for chemoprevention and treatment of lung cancer in smokers.},

Furthermore, the involvement of CDK4-mediated cell cycle progression and its molecular basis were investigated in the pathogenesis of lung cancer. METHODS: Using immunohistochemistry analysis, we analyzed CDK4 protein expression in 89 clinicopathologically characterized lung cancer patients (59 males and 30 females) with ages ranging from 36 to 78 years and compared them to 23 normal lung tissues. Cases with cytoplasmic and nuclear CDK4 immunostaining score values greater than or equal to 7 were regarded as high expression while scores less than 7 were considered low expression. The correlation between the expression level of CDK4 and clinical features was analyzed. Furthermore, we used lentiviral-mediated shRNA to suppress the expression of CDK4 and investigate its function and molecular mechanism for mediating cell cycle progression. RESULTS: The expression level of CDK4 protein was significantly increased in lung cancer tissues compared to normal tissues (P < 0.001). In addition, high levels of CDK4 protein were positively correlated with the status of pathology classification (P = 0.047), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.007), and clinical stage (P = 0.004) of lung cancer patients. Patients with higher CDK4 expression had a markedly shorter overall survival time than patients with low CDK4 expression. Multivariate analysis suggested the level of CDK4 expression was an independent prognostic indicator (P < 0.001) for the survival of patients with lung cancer. Use of lentiviral-mediated shRNA to inhibit the expression of CDK4 in lung cancer cell line A549 not only inhibited cell cycle progression, but also dramatically suppressed cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration. Furthermore, suppressing CDK4 expression also significantly elevated the expression of cell cycle regulator p21 CONCLUSION: Overexpressed CDK4 is a potential unfavorable prognostic factor and mediates cell cycle progression by regulating the expression of p21 in lung cancer.},

Firstly, we analyzed 86 NSCLC samples by immunohistochemistry and found that E2F2 expression was markedly increased in 62.8% (54/86) of all samples compared with the normal tissues. Further study showed that E2F2 expression was closely associated with clinical stage (P = 0.039) and tumor size (P = 0.045). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that high Bad expression was significantly correlated to overall survival (P = 0.045) but not disease-free survival (P = 0.288). In addition, our results showed that knockdown E2F2 expression could reduce cell viability and colony formation in NSCLC cells. The results in our study for the first time revealed that E2F2 act as an activator in tumor progress of NSCLC and could become a promising marker for the prognosis of patients with NSCLC.},

In a continuing effort to create clear and integrated visualizations that facilitate the gathering of novel biological insights despite the overwhelming complexity of data, we present here the GrAph LANdscape VisualizaTion (GALANT), a Cytoscape plugin that builds functional landscapes onto biological networks. By using GALANT, it is possible to project any type of numerical data onto a network to create a smoothed data map resembling the network layout. As a Cytoscape plugin, GALANT is further improved by the functionalities of Cytoscape, the popular bioinformatics package for biological network visualization and data integration.Availability:  http://www.lbbc.ibb.unesp.br/galant.Contact:  esther@ibb.unesp.brSupplementary Information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},

The motivation for this software comes from two previous publications (Nucleic Acids Res., 35, 1859–1867, 2007; Nucleic Acids Res., 36, 6269–6283, 2008). The first article presents a network-based model of genome stability pathways where we defined a set of genes that characterizes each genetic system. In the second article we analyzed this model by projecting functional information from several experiments onto the gene network topology. In order to systematize the methods developed in these articles, ViaComplex provides tools that may help potential users to assess different high-throughput experiments in the context of six core genome maintenance mechanisms. This model illustrates how different gene networks can be analyzed by the same algorithm.Availability:  http://lief.if.ufrgs.br/pub/biosoftwares/viacomplexSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.Contact:  mauro@ufrgs.br or rita@if.ufrgs.br}},

Their connectivity network needs to be considered for the full understanding of biological phenomena, but the available information on protein–protein associations is incomplete and exhibits varying levels of annotation granularity and reliability. The STRING database aims to collect, score and integrate all publicly available sources of protein–protein interaction information, and to complement these with computational predictions. Its goal is to achieve a comprehensive and objective global network, including direct (physical) as well as indirect (functional) interactions. The latest version of STRING (11.0) more than doubles the number of organisms it covers, to 5090. The most important new feature is an option to upload entire, genome-wide datasets as input, allowing users to visualize subsets as interaction networks and to perform gene-set enrichment analysis on the entire input. For the enrichment analysis, STRING implements well-known classification systems such as Gene Ontology and KEGG, but also offers additional, new classification systems based on high-throughput text-mining as well as on a hierarchical clustering of the association network itself. The STRING resource is available online at https://string-db.org/.}},

  abstract     = {MicroRNAs play key roles in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. In this study, we described the regulation and function of miR-1469 in apoptosis of lung cancer cells (A549 and NCI-H1650). Expression analysis verified that miR-1469 expression significantly increased in apoptotic cells. Overexpression of miR-1469 in lung cancer cells increased cell apoptosis induced by etoposide. Additionally, we identified that Stat5a is a downstream target of miR-1469, which can bind directly to the 3'-untranslated region of the Stat5a, subsequently reducing both the mRNA and protein levels of Stat5a. Finally, co-expression of miR-1469 and Stat5a in A549 and NCI-H1650 cells partially abrogated the effect of miR-1469 on cell apoptosis. Our results show that miR-1469 functions as an apoptosis enhancer to regulate lung cancer apoptosis through targeting Stat5a and may become a critical therapeutic target in lung cancer. },
